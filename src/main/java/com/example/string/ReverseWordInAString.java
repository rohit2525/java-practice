Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"

Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
